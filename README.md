# **Catch the Clown**
This is a simple game created using Pygame, where the player has to catch a randomly moving clown within a certain time frame and a limited number of lives, in order to score points and win the game.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The image files, fonts and audios used in the program

## **Installing**
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/CatchTheClown.git**

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 catch_the_clown.py

## **How to Play**
Use your mouse to click on the clown and catch it.
If you catch the clown, your score will increase, and the clown will move in a new random direction.
If you miss the clown, you will lose one life.
You have a limited amount of time to catch the clown before the game ends.
You also have a limited number of lives, and if you lose all of them, the game will end.
Click anywhere on the screen to play again after the game is over.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Changing the size of the game window by modifying theWINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT constants in the code.
2. Changing the starting number of lives by modifying the PLAYER_STARTING_LIVES constant.
3. Changing the starting speed of the clown and how much it accelerates with each successful catch by modifying the CLOWN_STARTING_VELOCITY and CLOWN_ACCELERATION constants.
4. Changing the maximum game time by modifying the MAX_GAME_TIME constant.
5. You can also change the fonts, colors, images and sounds as you prefer by modifying the relevant sections of the code.
